# Jazz-For-The-Soul
# This web app is meant to serve as a website for PSLradio who plays music suggested from students in the morning. It is intended to allow students to send in song names and display it on the site. In my opinion, saving the world should be done one step at a time, and I envision a world filled with music that stem from endless genres.
